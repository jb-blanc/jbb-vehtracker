# [QBCore] JBB Vehicle Tracker

This FiveM ressource makes GPS tracking of vehicle available for players on QBCore servers.
As a player, you can : 
* Put a tracker on a vehicle on a given channel (between 1 and 100)
* Set and change the channel on the receiver (by default between 1 and 100)
* Scan a vehicle to see if there is any tracking device on it
* Remove the tracking device if there's one

All is developed for QBCore and won't be translated/adapted for ESX by myself. If you want to, you can fork or make a PR ;)
Feel free to report any bug on the issue tab.
